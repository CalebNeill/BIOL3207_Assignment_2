# BIOL3207_Assignment_2

## Project description
A meta analysis of the ocean acidification studies from 2009 to 2020. Project incorporates a new study into the meta data for the other studies provided followed by a meta analysis and an attempt to convey possible publication bias.

Issues regarding the orchaRd package installing and the data itself being so large and hard to work with regarding change in signs and extreme values resulted in editing of data which is not ideal but due to time restrictions was needed. For a more in depth and proper analysis, implementation of the orchaRd package and code to adjust these factors is needed.

## How to use project
The coding language used was R in a R markdown document. The data obtained was in multiple excel documents that are needed in order to run the code.

## Credits
The data provided is shown in the meta data with author and title included. The code was partially provided by ANU BIOL3207 workshops and adjusted to fit the data and solve problems faced during the project.

## Conclusion
The data was messy but cleaned enough to hopefully follow along. This project can provide solutions to potential problems during meta analysis of a large meta dataset.
